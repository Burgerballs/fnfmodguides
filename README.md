# FNF MOD GUIDES (WIP)

fnfmodguides is a project started by Burgerballs (me!) in order to comprehensively teach an aspiring FNF mod creator how to make their mod. 

# Questions

## Why does this guide not cover anything art related?

This guide assumes that you know art or somebody else made the art you'll use within the mod, because I honestly know nothing about art despite my increasing interest into learning how to do it.

## Should this guide be followed 1-to-1?

You can choose to match the guide's advice 1-to-1 but you can choose to go against the advice where you see fit, because creative freedom is what keeps the the community fun and enjoyable to be in.

## Can you fix some innacuracies within your guide if I happen to see any?

If you see innacuracies within my guide feel free to open an Issue or a Pull Request, I aim to make sure the guide does not fail in terms of teaching people how to make FNF mods. So giving corrections when nesassary will help bring me closer to my goal.
