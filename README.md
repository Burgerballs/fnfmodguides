# FNF MOD GUIDES

fnfmodguides is a project started by Burgerballs (me!) in order to comprehensively teach an aspiring FNF mod creator how to make their mod. 

# Questions

## Why does this guide not cover anything art related?

This guide assumes that you know art or somebody else made the art you'll use within the mod, because I honestly know nothing about art despite my increasing interest into learning how to do it.

## Should this guide be followed 1-to-1

You can choose to match the guide's advice 1-to-1 but you can choose to go against the advice where you see fit, because creative freedom is what keeps the the community fun and enjoyable to be in.
