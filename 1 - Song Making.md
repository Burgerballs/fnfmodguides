# 1 - Song Making

You cannot have an FNF mod without a song to go along with it. You could use other people's songs (If permission is available and credit is given. Don't steal, kiddos),  but that is a thing I will not talk about within this guide.

## The Software

Before making an FNF song you will be needing software in order to make one, I highly suggest using a DAW, you are free to also use other things like trackers and raw audio editors like Audacity, but it's advisable that you should be using a DAW for this guide.

The software we will be using is the one I am used to, FL Studio (20.9), I will not disclose how to obtain a copy of FL Studio, this guide assumes that you already have some sort of FL Studio on your computer, through any means that you deemed as nessasery when you obtained such thing. If you want to know how to make FNF songs on software that isn't FL Studio, I suggest looking at longestsoloever's tutorials on youtube, which make use of a different digital audio workstation (Ableton).
