# 1 - Song Making

You cannot have an FNF mod without a song to go along with it. You could use other people's songs (If permission is available and credit is given. Don't steal, kiddos),  but that is a thing I will not talk about within this guide.

## The Software

The software we will be using is the one I am used to, FL Studio (20.9), I will not disclose how to obtain a free copy of FL Studio, this guide assumes that you already have some sort of FL Studio on your computer, through any means that you deemed nessasery.
